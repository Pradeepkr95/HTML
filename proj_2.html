			<p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular,have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition;in fact,humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.Accordingly,fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output,and some have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible</p>

		<p>The health benefits of fruits guarantee you optimum health and a well-built body in the long run. Fruits benefit your body immensely as they are natural sources of vitamins and minerals, which are essential for the proper functioning of the body. Rich in dietary fiber, fruits also help to improve the functioning of the digestive tract. Fruits are an important part of a healthy diet for those who want to lose weight; they give ample energy and nearly every nutrient that your body needs to curb weight gain, without adding any unnecessary fats.
			A fruit stand is a primarily open-air business venue that sells seasonal fruit and many fruit products from local growers. It might also sell vegetables and various processed items derived from fruit. The fruit stand is a small business structure that is primarily run as an independent sole proprietorship, with very few franchises or branches of larger fruit stand conglomerates, though many large food industry businesses have developed from fruit stand businesses.The fruit shop has been a neighborhood hub for many generations and is one of the few enterprises that is important to every culture and readily available on every continent. Fruit stands still comprise a primary distribution system for the fresh produce consumed by millions in developing countries.</p>
